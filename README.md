# Chessies

A simple web-based chess game built entirely on the client side.
The game supports all standard chess rules. Pieces can be moved either by
clicking a piece and then a highlighted square or by dragging and dropping the
piece. Moves are logged in a simple PGN format so you can follow the game
history easily and there's a restart button to reset the board.

When a pawn reaches the far rank you'll be prompted to choose a promotion piece.
The new piece will appear on the board and the choice is recorded in the PGN log.
