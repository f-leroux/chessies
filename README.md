# Chessies

A simple web-based chess game built entirely on the client side.
The game supports all standard chess rules, drag and drop piece movement with
highlighted legal moves and a restart button to reset the board. Moves are
logged in a simple PGN format so you can follow the game history easily.

When a pawn reaches the far rank you'll be prompted to choose a promotion piece.
The new piece will appear on the board and the choice is recorded in the PGN log.
