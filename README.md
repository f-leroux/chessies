# Chessies

A simple web-based chess game. The project uses a React frontend and a Flask
backend. Currently it's just a skeleton to get development started.

## Development

### Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install        # install dependencies
npm start          # run webpack dev server
```

### Backend

```
cd backend
python app.py
```
